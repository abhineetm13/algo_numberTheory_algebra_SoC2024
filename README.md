# Algorithmic Number Theory and Algebra
This is my project repository for SoC 2024, mentored by <a href="https://github.com/Nilabha13">Nilabha Saha</a>. Below are the project details:

## Description
In this project, we will develop a library from scratch in Python implementing various algorithms for topics based on number theory and algebra. We will also implement algorithms which are used to attack several cryptosystems in the real world.

## Project Timeline
<ul>
    <li>Week 1: Congruences, Modular inverses, Euclid's Algorithm</li>
    <li>Week 2: Quadratic Residues, Chinese Remainder Theorem, Fast Exponentiation</li>
    <li>Week 3: Probabilistic Algorithms</li>
    <li>Week 4: Primality Checking (Probabilistic and Deterministic)</li>
    <li>Week 5: Quadratic Reciprocity, Modular Square Roots, Generator Finding, and Discrete Logarithm Problem</li>
    <li>Week 6: Subexponential-time algorithms for DLP and Factoring</li>
    <li>Week 7: Algorithms for Finite Fields</li>
    <li>Week 8: Documentation and Finalisation</li>
</ul>
